Q. why the hell there is 2 definition file available? it cant be put parameters togher in one file?  
  A. yes, it can be done.  
  but i already put +7000 0 address offset for main file, because i thought no need to edit before +7000 0 until now.  
  yes, i can delete address offset from main file, and adjust parameter address one by one, but it is clearly painful work.  
  so i leave it, and split into 2 files
