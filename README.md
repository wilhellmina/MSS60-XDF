# Q&A
Q. why the hell there is 2 definition file available? it cant be put parameters togher in one file?
  A. yes, it can be done. 
  but i already put +7000 0 address offset for main file, because i thought no need to edit before +7000 0 until now.
  yes, i can delete address offset from main file, and adjust parameter address one by one, but it is clearly painful work.
  so i leave it, and split into 2 files
